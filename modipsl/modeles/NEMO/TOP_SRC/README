DB

This dir modified to eliminate all code NOT related to BGCM_01 key. 
It will be broken for all the old OPA/NEMO keys (lobster, ...). 
The F91 files are copies of the original F90 files, saved for possible reference.

The key that works is:  key_BGCM_01 which requires key_passivetrc as well.

The 2 files: bgcm_01_*.F90 are simple, clean BioGeoChemical Model (or "NPZ") routines.
They can also serve as starting points for other BGCM code(s) by appropriate modification.

Recent modifications cleaned up the above and created:
lib_bgcm_01.F90, with modified bgcm_initrc & bgcm_model files.
